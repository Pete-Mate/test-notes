# Jegyzet
>the philosophical raw material comes directly from the world and our relation to it, not from writings of the past. That is why they come up again and again, in the heads of people who haven't read about them.
- nine philosophical problems
	- [[Knowledge of the world beyond our minds]] 
	- [[Knowledge of minds other than our own]]
	- [[The relation between mind and brain]] 
	- How language is possible 
	- Whether we have free will 
	- The basis of morality 
	- What inequalities are unjust 
	- The nature of death
	- The meaning of life
- no discussion of the great philosophers of the past and their writings

>the best way to begin the study of philosophy is to think about them directly.

>Philosophy is different from science and from mathematics. Unlike science it doesn't rely on experiments or observation, but only on thought. And unlike mathematics it has no formal methods of proof. It is done just by asking questions, arguing, trying out ideas and thinking of possible arguments against them, and wondering how our concepts really
work
